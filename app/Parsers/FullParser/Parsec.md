# The Parsec Library
- THe Parsec library defines a set of common combinations much like the operators defined in NanoParsec.hs
- 'char': Match the given character
- 'strng': Match the given string
- '<|>': The choice operator tries to parse the first argument before proceeding to the second
- 'many': Consumes an arbitrary number of patterns matching the given pattern and returns them as a list
- 'many1': Like many but requires at least one match
- 'sepBy': Match an arbitrary length sequence of patterns, delimited by a given pattern
- 'optional': Optionally parse a given pattern returning its value as a 'Maybe' monad
- 'try': Backtracking operator will let us parse ambiguous matching expressions and restart with a different pattern
- 'parens': Parses the given pattern surrounded by parenthesis
